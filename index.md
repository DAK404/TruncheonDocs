<marquee>| Welcome to the documentation page! This is under development and hence, you can follow the progress here. | Katana Update is being worked on as we speak. | This new structure shall help in maintaining the project files effectively, and hence it shall take quite some time for Truncheon's update to be released. |</marquee>

## Introduction

Truncheon is a lightweight, cross-platform and a user friendly shell written in Java. The program is now available, but with the documentation incomplete. The program is getting a new updated code, along with the documentation, but it shall be a while by the time it is complete. Please watch this space for updates and changes.

## What Next?

Well, now that the introduction about Truncheon is done, here are a few suggested actions:

* Download Truncheon now!
* Contribute to Truncheon Source Code!
* Are you new? Familiarize yourself with the guide!
* Build and expand upon Truncheon? Here is a reference guide!
* Improve the Truncheon code itself? Here is the complete program documentation!

(Yes, I know that I have not linked the pages, but will do it soon enough.)
